#Results Section
The growth parameters were varied in the experiments to achieve different morphologies of InGaN depending upon the amount of indium incorporation and resulting strain present in the sample. At 880 C with initial precursors of TMIn 200 sccm and TMGa of 10 sccm, the samples were shown to have 23% indium and a flower shaped hexagonal rings with a distinct hole in the center. It is well known from other studies that indium incorporation is strongly dependent upon temperature. But typically in other cases, the indium amount has been reported as 6% (Ref 1) at these temperatures while we were able to achieve 23% in our nanorings. This can be explained by the fact that strain relaxation is the driving force for the formation of the nanoring shape allowing for increased indium incorporation in this structure as compared with thin-films where material isn't able to flow. The XRD of this sample shows that they are very crystalline in nature, but the double peaks from the InN and GaN peak shows that phase separation is occurring in the rings. As the growth temperature is dropped 

* My rings have more indium at the same temperature than other studies!
